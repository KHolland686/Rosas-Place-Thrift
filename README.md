# Rosas Place Thrift
 Preliminary Layout for a website for thrift store.

 Will be adding Sections or pages with information for customers.
 My thoughts are:

 - 'About' Section with information about the store and/or owners
 - 'Photos' with photos of the store itself, or items for sale (could be linked with an Instagram, but would require someone to update regularly...).
 - 'Location' with address, directions, embedded map
 - 'Contact' with phone number, e-mail address, social media (Insta, Facebook...)
